His act of eager walking is still indicated, though he is stationary at the given moment; his dog is still bounding. The edge which opens on the depth has no terror; it is as if angels were waiting to uphold him, if it came about that he leaped from the height. His countenance is full of intelligence and expectant dream. He has a rose in one hand and in the other a costly wand, from which depends over his right shoulder a wallet curiously embroidered. He is a prince of the other world on his travels through this one - all amidst the morning glory, in the keen air. The sun, which shines behind him, knows whence he came, whither he is going, and how he will return by another path after many days.",

    "cspositive": "The encounter with material ambition and its challenges and rewards can be a productive and healing one. It is success through cleverness, discipline, activity and dynamic, the right qualities of leadership, authority and realism. This unashamed materialist is healthy and strong and he is pride of his achievement for power and recognition in the eyes of others. His need for material security brought him to receive this gift of manifesting creative ideas in the world, together with the radiating sun, the source of energy and creativity. So take up the challenge of worldly things, encounter this material self-confidence and it becomes at the same time a lesson about greed and the let go of material desires - a creation of inner and outer richness.",

The sign of this suit is represented throughout as engraved or blazoned with the pentagram, typifying the correspondence of the four elements in human nature and that by which they may be governed.",
    "shortdesc": "A dark man with a face suggesting courage, but somewhat lethargic. His throne is decorated with a bull motif."
